### Minor Changes

#### `pnpm help --all`

Added support for `--all` option in `pnpm help` to list all commands [#8628](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/8628).

### Patch Changes

- When the `latest` version doesn't satisfy the maturity requirement configured by `minimumReleaseAge`, pick the highest version that is mature enough, even if it has a different major version [#10100](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10100).
- `create` command should not verify patch info.
- Set `managePackageManagerVersions` to `false`, when switching to a different version of pnpm CLI, in order to avoid subsequent switches [#10063](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10063).
