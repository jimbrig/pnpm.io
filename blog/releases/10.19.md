This release adds version-scoped controls to two settings: [`onlyBuiltDependencies`] and [`minimumReleaseAgeExclude`].
<!-- truncate -->

### Minor Changes

#### Versions in `onlyBuiltDependencies`

You can now allow specific versions of dependencies to run postinstall scripts. [`onlyBuiltDependencies`] accepts package names with exact versions (and disjunctions via `||`). For example:

```yaml
onlyBuiltDependencies:
- nx@21.6.4 || 21.6.5
- esbuild@0.25.1
```

#### Versions in `minimumReleaseAgeExclude`

Added support for exact versions in [`minimumReleaseAgeExclude`]. This lets you opt specific versions out of the maturity window enforced by [`minimumReleaseAge`].

You can list one or more specific versions that pnpm should allow to install, even if those versions donâ€™t satisfy the maturity requirement set by [`minimumReleaseAge`]. For example:

```yaml
minimumReleaseAge: 1440
minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
- nx@21.6.5
- webpack@4.47.0 || 5.102.1
```
